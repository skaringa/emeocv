Prerequisites
=============

* g++, make
* OpenCV 2, 3, 4 (Debian/Ubuntu/Raspbian: `apt-get install libopencv-dev`) - developed with OpenCV 2.3.1 and later ported to OpenCV 3.2.0 and 4.2.0
* RRDtool (`apt-get install rrdtool librrd-dev`)
* log4cpp (`apt-get install liblog4cpp5-dev`)
* imagemagick (optional, only needed to display graphs)

Build
=====

    cd emeocv
    make

Usage
=====

    emeocv [-i <dir>|-c <cam>] [-l|-t|-a|-w|-o <dir>] [-s <delay>] [-v <level>]

    Image input:
        -i <image directory> : read image files (png) from directory.
        -c <camera number> : read images from camera.

    Operation:
        -a : adjust camera.
        -o <directory> : capture images into directory.
        -l : learn OCR.
        -t : test OCR.
        -w : write OCR data to RR database. This is the normal working mode.

    Options:
        -s <n> : Sleep n milliseconds after processing of each image (default=1000).
        -v <l> : Log level. One of DEBUG, INFO, ERROR (default).


There is a tutorial that explains use case and function of the program:
